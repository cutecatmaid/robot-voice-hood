<h1>Welcome!</h1><br />
This is just the skeleton of the website!

<h3>Text to Speech</h3><br />
<!--

All the code that will accompany the text to speech will go here!
Make sure to look at Shelby's design when setting up the div ids and classes.
Use this site: https://grid.layoutit.com/ It's a grid making website for the CSS. Using a template is for uncreative nerds so
we must do it manually.

<textarea class="tts-input" cols="30" id="input" name="input" placeholder="Type a message here that you wish to be spoken back!">
<!-- Add a fail-safe just in case there are characters that cannot be pronounced, probably the foreign language unicode characters. -->
